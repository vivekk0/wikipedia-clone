    <p>Fly, Eagles, Fly — Philadelphia has won the 2025 Super Bowl!

        The Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on Sunday, Feb. 9 to win the Vince Lombardi Trophy.<br>
        
        Led by quarterback Jalen Hurts and birthday boy/running back Saquon Barkley — who turned 28 on Sunday — the team stopped the Chiefs from achieving NFL history and becoming the first team to win the Super Bowl three years in a row.<br>
        
        The Eagles took the early lead in the game with six minutes to go in the first quarter, after a tush push from the 1-yard line resulted in a Hurts touchdown.<br>
        
        In the second quarter, the Eagles quarterback threw an interception but the Chiefs were unable to capitalize and put any points on the board.<br>
        
        Barkley wasn't the only Eagles player to have a day on his birthday.<br>
        Rookie cornerback Cooper DeJean, who turned 22 on Sunday, picked off Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and ran it back for a touchdown for the Eagles to go up 17-0.<br>

Wide receiver A.J. Brown then got in on the action, scoring a touchdown with less than 2 minutes to go in the half. Cameras caught the player hilariously repeating his past behavior of reading a book along the sidelines shortly after.<br>

The Chiefs went into the break down 24-0, and the game didn't get better for KC from there.

It took until nearly two minutes left in the third quarter for Mahomes and the offense to get past midfield following a 50-yard catch by rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy.<br>

Four plays later, Mahomes converted to Worthy in the end zone to keep the game from being a shutout. The Chiefs later scored another two touchdowns late in the fourth quarter but the game was already history.<br>

Sunday’s game was a rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl, which was also known as the Kelce Bowl.<br>

In that matchup, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and Eagles center Jason Kelce became the first brothers to face off in a Super Bowl. Both had previously won the big game, with Travis taking the championship with the Chiefs in 2020 and Jason with the Eagles in 2018.<br>
